I completed the Udemy course Cryptocurrency and Algorithmic Trading with Python and Binance

At the end of the course I created a trading algorithm class which received a live stream of data from the Binance API and executed trades.

I modified the class beyond the course content to send messages when trades were executed to a Telegram channel using the Telegram API and BotFather
